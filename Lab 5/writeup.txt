Algorithm Explanation:
	I made my program into a simple state machine. The states are as follows:
	SEARCH:
		The drone quickly ascends straight up until it seems the landing pad. 
		Moves to ROTATE.
	ROTATE:
		The drone rotates until the landing pad is located directly in front of it.
		Moves to FORWARD.
	FORWARD:
		The drone moves forward until it is directly above the landing pad.
		If it rotates accidentally, goes back to ROTATE.
		If it gets directly over the pad, goes to DESCEND.
	DESCEND:
		The drone stops all momentum and fine-tunes it's location until it is 
		confidently above the landing pad. 
		Moves to SHUTDOWN.
	SHUTDOWN:
		The drone shuts down its motors and falls to the landing pad.
		Hope no one was on board!
