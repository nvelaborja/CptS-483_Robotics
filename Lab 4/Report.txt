Conclusions:
	Based on our observations, the color-tracking method draws a far better square. To improve our code, we would probably have the robot move a little slower, and increased the magnitude threshold to detect stopping position. This would have the robot stop closer to, in our case, the yellow squares, which would make for a sharper turning angle.
